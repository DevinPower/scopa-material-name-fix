# Scopa

Scopa is a Unity level design plugin that adds Quake 1 .MAP (Valve 220 version) file import at editor time and/or runtime.

To build .MAP levels, we recommend the free open source multiplatform 3D level design tool [TrenchBroom](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom).

This is currently under development. When it's ready for public use, I'll add more instructions and documentation.
